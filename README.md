# ConsoleAppForTranslator

This is a symmetric encryption program which encrypts and decrypts strings. The project involves use of multithreading, Linq, 
inheritance and a rigorous use Regex pattern matching. It also includes a test class through which I have thoroughly unit tested the 
program. The test class also has a function which returns the percentage of accuracy of the whole program. Currently the accuracy is 
99.5% for 100 test strings. There is also another function which returns the average accuracy for a constant sample size.

There are detailed commments in the solution explaining how everything works.
